        <p class="line-summary"> As part of my internship project I had to learn about HTTPS, how it works and how to use HTTPS to secure SOAP based web services written in java.
Why do we need HTTPS? The document transfer protocol of choice for the internet, HTTP uses a plain text format for transfering data. Hence anyone who is able to intercept the communication channel(MITM attack) can view everything that is being transmitted by the sender and receiver. </p>

Progress: Week 2 Got a pretty good understanding of SOAP and WSDL Got and overview of the tls/ssl protocol and how the whole certification system works.. but the protocol is huge and would need some more time and fiddling to wrap my head around it. Wrote a very basic soap service, secured it with https. </p>

        <p class="line-summary"> So, the summer vacation has started, finally! But no relaxing this time around. I&rsquo;m doing an internship at a company called Lexmark. The first week here has been pretty interesting.. the people here are cool, friendly. The work environment is also awsome, there are no restrictions or visible structure in the organisation. Very different from what my perception was about an Information Technology company.
The good parts: KFC for lunch on the first day Free Coffee and Lunch There are Bean Bags in the office! </p>

Most git repositories provide ssh links. So to get git working I needed to get ssh working first. A simple nmap showed that there are 4 ports open on the proxy server one of them being the ssh port: 22. </p>

The tool people use to do this is called Jenkins. So here&rsquo;s the rundown of what I have been able to achieve.
First of all I havent been able to automatically build the app for deployment. What I&rsquo;ve been able to do is setup a jenkins server, create a new job which receives an event from Github notifying a modification, after receiving which it simply pulls the changes from Github and pushes it to the Openshift server running the django app. </p>

        <p class="line-summary"> Openshift is a new app hosting service from RedHat which offers a great free package. Till now I&rsquo;ve used Heroku to host some apps and its great but it doesn&rsquo;t provide any free database (well it does but you&rsquo;ll have to enter your credit card details which in India few people have). Also the filesystem of heroku is such that it refreshes every 24hrs deleting every thing except the repo. So heroku is great for testing but hosting something with somesort of a database is not possible unless you pay. </p>
