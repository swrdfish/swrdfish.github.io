      <description>So I have got my django app running on Openshift. ([how to run django app on Openshift]({% post_url 2014-12-29-django-on-openshift %})) Now I wanted to automate the deployment of the app from a Github repo. The tool people use to do this is called Jenkins. So here&amp;rsquo;s the rundown of what I have been able to achieve.&#xA;First of all I havent been able to automatically build the app for deployment. What I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to do is setup a jenkins server, create a new job which receives an event from Github notifying a modification, after receiving which it simply pulls the changes from Github and pushes it to the Openshift server running the django app.</description>
