I'm a linux/unix guy, I've always had heated debates with my "Windows" friends about how good the unix environment is and how the terminal can do magical things.. 
But today I was hit on the face, real hard. This [guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/06/17/giving-powershell-a-persistent-history-of-commands) show us the steps to make powershell as good as if not even better than bash is some ways.

Thanks [@Ananyo](http://github.com/backlogaddict) for the link. 'Ar kono dabi nei, windows bhalo'
