One of my elder brother (cousine) is a very good photographer. He wanted a portfolio website to showcase his work. So me and my brother built him a website which could do justice to the quality of the photographs he took. The unique thing about this website was that it didn't store the images in the server (the server had limited storage capacity). Instead the photos were kept in Google Photos and accessed via their api and represented in a customised way.
