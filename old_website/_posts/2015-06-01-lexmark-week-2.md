So one more week just flew past! Progress: not much.. I spent the whole week studying.. 

### Progress: Week 2
+ Got a pretty good understanding of [SOAP](http://www.w3.org/TR/soap) and [WSDL](http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20)
+ Got and overview of the tls/ssl protocol and how the whole certification system works.. but the protocol is huge and would need some more time and fiddling to wrap my head around it.
+ Wrote a very basic soap service, secured it with https.
+ Was able to run my service from within the [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and secure it using https as well.
+ Hence I've got an overview of how Java servlets and servlet containers function.
+ Was able to verify the services security using [wireshark]() to look into the packets and verify that they are encrypted.


### Todo:
I'm going to write another blog post explaining what I've learnt so far mentioning the source documents so that others in the team can get a better understanding of https.
