So, I'm going to give a final shot at blogging. 
I've used Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr previousl but have never been able to be stick to it. Being a regular blogger has been on my todo list for like forever. But till now I've only written a post or two in each platform.


Well here's a new blogging platform and a final attempt. Jekyll seems a good option for me as it minimises the friction of blogging a lot. I can write and publish a post from sublime. I mean what can be better right.


OK, now the thing is what am I going to write about? Well I'm a wannabe developer/maker/hacker so, I guess the best option for me would be to regularly document my projects here. Also the Jekyll site is going to be like an online portfolio for me. And there we go.. let the blogging begin.
