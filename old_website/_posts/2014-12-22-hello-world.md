All righty. So finally I've started using Jekyll. No more Wordpress or Tumblr. Just a git push and there we go.
**Awsome!** 


{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
	print "Hi, " + name

print_hi('Bisu') #prints 'Hi, Bisu' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


And we have highlighted code right there!
